<h1>User Problem</h1>

A developer would like to configure an application or the application runtime deployed to Openshift.

<h1>Description</h1>

This project demonstrates application and runtime configuration leveraging external configuration sources. Alongside the basic means to set up a configmap and use with a specific runtime, this quickstart also demonstrates how changes to the configuration can be applied to services already deployed to openshift.
